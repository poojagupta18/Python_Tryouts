Python have some standard libaries also called modules. We can import the modules
and can use the built in functions.
Example:
On shell    
>>> import random
>>> random.randint(1,10)
1
>>> random.randint(1,10)
2
>>> random.randint(1,10)
6
>>> random.randint(1,10)
9

If we do not want to write modulename.built_in_function() in that case import * from that module as shown below
>>> from random import *
>>> randint(1,10)
5
>>> randint(1,10)
6
>>> randint(1,10)
6
>>> randint(1,10)
2

We can import any number modules at a time
>>> import random, sys, os, math

sys.exit() do not have impact on shell
>>> sys.exit()
>>>
